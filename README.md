# Scientific Writing

* Every sentence should be necessary
* Have one idea per sentence or paragraph and one topic per section.
* Have a straightforward, logical organization.
    `\paragraph`, example sections (see below), etc. are your friends.
* Use short words.
* Prefer simple words.
* Use short sentences with simple structure.
    Bad:
    > The object under consideration is displaced horizontally.
    Good:
    > The ball moves sideways.
* Keep paragraphs short.
* Avoid buzzwords, clichÃ©s, and slang.
* Avoid excess, in length or style.
* Omit unnecessary material.
* Be specific, not vague or abstract.

* Use examples.
    * Use dedicated example blocks:
    > Example 3.5. With this algorithm we obtain Listing 3.2 from Listing 3.1.
    * Often an informative example is just a few words:
    > Special cases, such as the empty set, need to be handled separately.

* Every story needs a hero (prefer active over passive).
    Bad:
    > The loop is unrolled four times.
    By whom?
        * The programmer,
        * the compiler,
        * some cool programming technique?
    Good:
    > The compiler unrolls the loop four times.

    Bad:
    > The following theorem can now be proved.
    Better:
    > We now prove the following theorem.

    * "We" (the authors/the author and the reader) is often a better alternative than passive voice but often there is even a better one:
    Bad:
    > X is simplified to Y, as Rule R is triggered.
    Better:
    > We apply Rule R to simplify X to Y.
    Even better (only makes sense when using inference rules etc.):
    > Rule R triggers and simplifies X to Y.

* can, can, can
    Plz stop using "can"!
    Bad:
    > We can then generate LLVM code.
    Okay, does this mean you actually *do* emit LLVM code or is this sth you could theoretically do but haven't implemented yet?
    Good:
    > Then, the compiler emits LLVM code.

    Bad:
    > We can express this relation in the following code.
    Better:
    > We express this relation in the following code.
    Even better:
    > The following code expresses this relation.

* Don't judge:
    Bad:
    > The benchmark shows a tremendous speedup.
    Good:
    > The benchmark shows a significant speedup of 20%-40%.

    Bad:
    >The problem can be solved with the following simple algorithm.
    Use active voice, remove "can", and whether the algorithm is simple or not is sth the reader has to decide on their own:
    Good:
    > The following algorithm solves this problem.

* Don't start a sentence with math or code.
    Bad:
    > m denotes the mass.
    Good:
    > In Newton's laws of motion, m denotes the mass.

    Bad:
    > rec recurses over the graph.
    Good:
    > The function rec recurses over the graph.

* Make sure that a sentence makes sense, if you elide citations (`\citet` is your friend):
    Bad:
    > As [23] points out ...
    Good:
    > Dijkstra [23] points out ...

* Good illustrations are a lot of work but often way better and clearer than complicated text that nobody understands.
* Only use pseudo-code, if you **really** need to bring a certain point across such as arguing about the asymptotic runtime.
    * Often it is better to just show a stripped-down version of the real code.
    * Usually, a "math"-version is better such as inference rules or proper mathematical functions.
    * Sometimes it's better to run through an example with accompanying figures.

* Break these rules if there is a good reason to do so.
